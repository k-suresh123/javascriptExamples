/*
 javascript objects supports only one key ,
if we add multiple object key ,it only remeber last one.


javascript objecct doesnt itterrate

map functions= set,get,delete

/*
	Map	Object
map:Accidental Keys	A Map does not contain any keys by default. It only contains what is explicitly put into it.
obj:An Object has a prototype, so it contains default keys that could collide with your own keys if you're not careful.

Note: As of ES5, this can be bypassed by using Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.

map:Key Types	A Map's keys can be any value (including functions, objects, or any primitive).	
obj:The keys of an Object must be either a String or a Symbol.
Key Order	

map:The keys in Map are ordered. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
obj:The keys of an Object are not ordered.

Note: Since ECMAScript 2015, objects do preserve creation order for string and Symbol keys. In JavaScript engines that comply with the ECMAScript 2015 spec,
 iterating over an object with only string keys will yield the keys in order of insertion.

map:Size	The number of items in a Map is easily retrieved from its size property.
obj:	The number of items in an Object must be determined manually.

map:Iteration	A Map is an iterable, so it can be directly iterated.	
obj:Iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.

Performance	
map:Performs better in scenarios involving frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs.
obj:Not optimized for frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs.


1) A WeakMap accepts only objects as keys whereas a Map,in addition to objects, accepts primitive datatype such as strings, numbers etc.

2) WeakMap objects doesn't avert garbage collection if there are no references to the object which is acting like a key. Therefore there is no method to retrieve keys in WeakMap, whereas in Map there are methods such as Map.prototype.keys() to get the keys.

3) There is no size property exists in WeakMap.

/* differen between map and object 
 we get size of map using size key word,
but  object size is not decided by size  property;

map keys not duplicate ,its remember last one when duplicates are there
